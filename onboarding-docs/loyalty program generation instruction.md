# loyalty program generation instructions

## purpose

this document tells you — the LLM — how to take a loyalty program archetype and produce a fully customized, business-specific loyalty program. you are not creating a program from scratch. you are substituting values into an existing structure.

**the schema (keys, columns, JSON structure) is fixed. you only change values.**

---

## inputs you will receive

before generating a program, you will have access to:

1. **business profile** — collected and inferred during onboarding:
   - `business_name`
   - `industry`
   - `offering_type` (product / service / both)
   - `services_and_products` (1–2 sentence description)
   - `primary_goal` (acquire / retain / revenue)
   - `visit_frequency` (high / medium / low)
   - `spend_variance` (consistent / varied)
   - `brand_personality` (inferred object — may be null if website unavailable):
     - `tone` — dominant voice register: playful / warm / premium / clinical / irreverent / minimalist / bold / community-driven
     - `identity_keywords` — 2–4 words extracted from brand copy (e.g. "handcrafted", "neighborhood", "sustainable")
     - `price_positioning` — budget / mid-market / premium / luxury
     - `customer_relationship_model` — transactional / community / membership / expert-to-customer

2. **recommendation** — the program type selected by the decision rules:
   - one of: `points` | `tiered` | `cashback` | `punch_card` | `coalition` | `points_tiers`

3. **archetype** — the matching row from `loyalty_program_examples`, loaded from Supabase based on `program_type`

---

## step-by-step generation process

### step 1 — load the correct archetype

match `recommendation` to the archetype's `program_type` field. load that full row. this is your base. do not mix fields from different archetypes.

---

### step 2 — read `llm_customization_hints` first

before touching any field, read the archetype's `llm_customization_hints` in full. it tells you:

- which fields to vary based on `industry`
- which fields to vary based on `primary_goal`
- which fields to vary based on program-specific inputs (e.g. `vary_currency_name`, `vary_tier_names`, `vary_cashback_rate`)
- which fields are **fixed** and must not be changed

treat `keep_fixed` as hard constraints. if a hint says to keep a value fixed, do not change it regardless of other signals from the business profile.

---

### step 3 — apply brand personality

before touching any individual field, resolve how `brand_personality` will influence the output. do this once, up front, so every field that follows benefits from a consistent brand reading.

if `brand_personality` is null, skip this step entirely and rely on industry-level defaults in `llm_customization_hints`.

if `brand_personality` is present, work through each sub-field and record your intended application:

**`tone` → drives `program_name`, `brand_voice_summary`, `referral_description`**

- playful / irreverent: use punchy, unexpected naming; referral copy should be casual and fun
- warm / community-driven: naming should feel like belonging; referral copy frames it as "bring someone in"
- premium / minimalist: naming should be short and understated; avoid exclamation marks everywhere
- bold: naming can be confident and declarative; voice should feel like the brand is doing the customer a favor by letting them join
- clinical: keep naming functional and clear; voice copy should lead with facts, not feelings

**`identity_keywords` → drives `currency_name` (points programs), `program_name`**

- pick the keyword that is most noun-like and translates well to a reward unit
- the currency name should feel like something the business would actually say, not a generic stand-in
- if no keyword works as a currency noun, derive from the core product (a florist's "Blooms", a butcher's "Cuts")
- for `program_name`, use the keywords to anchor the name in the brand's world — avoid names that could belong to any business

**`price_positioning` → drives `reward_tiers` perks, `bonus_rules` framing**

- budget: perks should lead with savings and tangible discounts; avoid aspirational language like "exclusive" or "curated"
- mid-market: balance savings with light status signals; a free item or early access feels right
- premium: perks should emphasize access, experience, and recognition over dollar discounts; "15% off" as a top-tier perk feels cheap for a premium brand — replace with complimentary services, dedicated support, or first-look access
- luxury: never use percentage discounts as a primary perk at any tier; rewards should be experiential, personal, and scarce

**`customer_relationship_model` → drives `brand_voice_summary`, `referral_description`, tier naming**

- transactional: voice is efficient and benefit-forward. referral copy: "share your code, you both save." tier names should be functional (Basic / Plus / Pro), not aspirational
- community: voice emphasizes belonging. referral copy: "bring a friend into the fold." tier names can reference shared identity (Member / Regular / Local Legend)
- membership: voice emphasizes access and earned status. referral copy: "invite someone you think belongs here." tier names should feel like levels of inner access (Access / Insider / Inner Circle)
- expert-to-customer: voice emphasizes trust and guidance. referral copy: "recommend us to someone who'd benefit." tier names can reflect progression of trust or knowledge (Beginner / Practitioner / Expert)

---

### step 4 — customize each field

work through every field in the archetype in order. for each field, apply one of four actions:

| action         | when to use                                                            |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **substitute** | replace a placeholder value with a business-specific one               |
| **adjust**     | modify a number, rate, or threshold to fit the business context        |
| **rewrite**    | reword text to match the business's brand voice                        |
| **keep**       | leave the value exactly as-is (always do this for `keep_fixed` fields) |

field-by-field rules follow.

#### `program_type`

**keep.** never change. this is the structural anchor for the row.

---

#### `industry`

**substitute.** replace the archetype's example industry with the actual business industry from the onboarding profile.

---

#### `program_name`

**rewrite.** invent a short, branded program name that fits the business. follow these rules:

- 1–3 words
- reflects what the business sells or the feeling it creates
- avoid generic names like "Rewards Club" or "Loyalty Points"
- good patterns: `[Brand] Rewards`, `[Noun] Credits`, `The [Aspirational Word]` (for tiered), `[Product Noun] Back` (for cashback)
- examples: a bookshop → "Dog-Eared Rewards"; a yoga studio → "Flow Credits"; a wine shop → "The Cellar"

if `brand_personality` is available:

- draw the name from `identity_keywords` first — the name should feel native to this brand's vocabulary
- let `tone` shape the register: premium/minimalist brands → short, understated names; playful brands → names with personality; community-driven brands → names that imply belonging
- let `customer_relationship_model` shape the structure: membership models → "The [Word]" works well; transactional models → "[Noun] Rewards" or "[Noun] Back" is cleaner"

---

#### `currency_name`

**rewrite** (points programs only). rename the archetype's placeholder currency to something on-brand.

- use a noun related to what the business sells or its identity
- singular form, capitalized (e.g. "Paws", "Pages", "Drops", "Miles")
- for cashback: currency is always displayed as a dollar value — do not rename it
- for tiered: there is no currency — keep the archetype's `currency_name` value noting it is spend-based

if `brand_personality` is available:

- scan `identity_keywords` for the most noun-like term that could work as a reward unit
- if a keyword maps cleanly to a physical thing the business deals in, use it (a tea shop with keyword "leaf" → "Leaves"; a bookshop with keyword "page" → "Pages")
- if no keyword translates, fall back to the core product or service noun
- never use a currency name that sounds corporate or abstract — it should feel like this specific business coined it

---

#### `earn_rules`

**adjust** the rates and **substitute** the qualifying actions to match the business.

- keep `base_rate` structure identical; only change the number if margin data or industry hints suggest it
- replace `qualifying_actions` with actions that make sense for this business's offering type:
  - a service business (e.g. salon) earns on appointments, not product purchases
  - a gym earns on class check-ins, monthly membership, personal training sessions
  - a café earns on drinks, beans, and merchandise
- keep the welcome bonus and birthday bonus mechanics — only rename them to fit the currency name
- do not add qualifying actions not present in the archetype unless `llm_customization_hints.vary_by_industry` explicitly suggests one

---

#### `redemption_rules`

**keep** the structure and thresholds fixed for points and cashback (these are in `keep_fixed`).

- substitute the currency name throughout
- for tiered programs, keep the "automatic / no manual redemption" mechanic — do not convert it to a points redemption
- do not change `partial_redemption_allowed` — keep it true

---

#### `reward_tiers` (tiered programs only)

**rewrite** tier names and **adjust** thresholds and perks.

- rename all three tiers to fit the brand (see `vary_tier_names` hint)
- calibrate `qualification_threshold` amounts using this rule: the top tier should be reachable by roughly the top 10–15% of customers. if you have no spend data, use the archetype defaults and note they should be validated post-launch
- rewrite perks to match what this business can actually offer:
  - a product business offers discounts, free items, early product access
  - a service business offers free sessions, priority booking, complimentary add-ons
  - do not include perks the business cannot deliver (e.g. "personal stylist" for a car wash)
- `tier_rank` values and structure: keep fixed

if `brand_personality` is available:

- use `customer_relationship_model` to name the tiers (see step 3 guidance for naming patterns per model)
- use `price_positioning` to determine what kind of perks belong at each level:
  - budget/mid-market: lead with savings — discounts, free items, reduced minimums for free shipping
  - premium: lead with access and experience — early product drops, dedicated service, complimentary consultations
  - luxury: no percentage discounts; perks should be personal, experiential, and feel genuinely scarce — private appointments, bespoke packaging, invitation-only events

---

#### `tier_progression_rules` (tiered programs only)

**keep** all values fixed except `starting_tier` name (rename to match the new tier 1 name).

- do not change the 90-day grace period
- do not change upgrade timing logic (immediate on threshold crossing)
- do not change downgrade policy (one tier down, not to bottom)

---

#### `points_expiry_rules`

**keep** for cashback (365 days is intentional for price-sensitive customers).
**adjust** for points programs based on `primary_goal`:

- `retain` or `revenue` goal: tighten to 90 days to create urgency
- `acquire` goal: keep at 180 days to reduce friction for new members
  **not applicable** for tiered — keep the archetype's "not applicable" value.

---

#### `bonus_rules`

**adjust** amounts and **rewrite** trigger labels to use the new currency name.

- keep all trigger types present in the archetype — do not remove any
- adjust bonus amounts based on `primary_goal`:
  - `acquire`: increase welcome and referral bonuses; these are acquisition hooks
  - `retain`: add or strengthen streak/frequency bonuses
  - `revenue`: add or strengthen spend-threshold bonuses
- rename trigger descriptions to match the business (e.g. "double_points_day" → "Double Paws Day" for a pet store)
- do not invent new trigger types not in the archetype

---

#### `referral_description`

**rewrite** in plain language using the business's currency name and brand voice.

- keep the same mechanic (both parties rewarded, first purchase required)
- adjust reward amounts to match any changes made to `bonus_rules`
- write in second person ("share your link…"), conversational tone

if `brand_personality` is available:

- use `tone` to set formality: playful/irreverent → casual and punchy; warm/community → inviting and personal; premium → polished and restrained
- use `customer_relationship_model` to frame the ask:
  - transactional: "share your code. you get [X], they get [X]." — direct, no sentiment
  - community: "know someone who'd love it here? bring them in — you'll both be rewarded."
  - membership: "think someone belongs in [program name]? invite them — and earn [X] when they join."
  - expert-to-customer: "if you know someone who could benefit, pass it on. you'll earn [X] when they make their first purchase."

---

#### `brand_voice_summary`

**rewrite** to reflect this specific business's identity.

- 2–3 sentences
- describe the tone (e.g. playful, premium, clinical, warm, irreverent)
- describe the relationship the program should communicate (thank-you, membership, partnership)
- include one concrete example of how the voice should sound in a notification or email subject line
- do not describe mechanics here — this is tone only

if `brand_personality` is available, this field should be a direct synthesis of it:

- sentence 1: name the tone and what it means in practice for this program — drawn from `tone` + `identity_keywords`
- sentence 2: describe the relationship framing — drawn from `customer_relationship_model`
- sentence 3: give a concrete example notification or subject line that demonstrates the voice in action

example (tone=warm, keywords=["neighborhood","handcrafted"], model=community):

> "the program should feel like a handwritten thank-you note from a neighbor, not a corporate points statement. every touchpoint should reinforce that customers are part of something local and made-by-hand, not just transacting. a push notification might read: 'your Brews are waiting, [first name] — come back and use them.'"

example (tone=premium, keywords=["curated","considered"], model=membership):

> "the program communicates exclusivity through restraint — never shouting about discounts, always signaling access. language should be warm but economical, as if the brand assumes the customer already understands its value. a tier upgrade email might open: 'you've reached Insider. here's what that means for you.'"

if `brand_personality` is null: write the summary based on industry defaults and the archetype's example voice.

---

#### `terms_and_conditions`

**substitute** all `[bracketed placeholders]` with the correct values:

- `[Program Name]` → the new `program_name`
- `[Currency Name]` → the new `currency_name`
- `[Business Name]` → `business_name` from onboarding
- `[X]` values → the corresponding numbers from `earn_rules`, `redemption_rules`, and `points_expiry_rules`
- `[DATE]` → leave as-is (populated at publish time)
- `[State/Jurisdiction]` → leave as-is (populated by the business)
- `[Address]`, `[Email]`, `[Phone]` → leave as-is (populated by the business)

do not rewrite the legal prose. do not change section structure. do not add or remove clauses. only fill in the placeholders.

---

### step 5 — consistency check

before outputting the final program, verify:

1. **currency name is consistent** across `currency_name`, `earn_rules`, `redemption_rules`, `bonus_rules`, `referral_description`, and `terms_and_conditions` — it should be identical everywhere
2. **program name is consistent** across `program_name` and `terms_and_conditions`
3. **tier names are consistent** across `reward_tiers`, `tier_progression_rules`, and `terms_and_conditions` (tiered only)
4. **numbers match** — every rate, threshold, and bonus amount in `terms_and_conditions` matches the corresponding value in `earn_rules`, `redemption_rules`, `bonus_rules`, and `points_expiry_rules`
5. **no placeholder brackets remain** in any field except `[DATE]`, `[State/Jurisdiction]`, `[Address]`, `[Email]`, and `[Phone]`

---

### step 6 — output format

output the completed program as a single JSON object that matches the Supabase row structure. omit `id` and `created_at` — these are auto-generated on insert.

```json
{
  "program_type": "...",
  "industry": "...",
  "program_name": "...",
  "currency_name": "...",
  "earn_rules": { ... },
  "redemption_rules": { ... },
  "reward_tiers": null,
  "tier_progression_rules": null,
  "points_expiry_rules": { ... },
  "bonus_rules": [ ... ],
  "referral_description": "...",
  "brand_voice_summary": "...",
  "llm_customization_hints": { ... },
  "terms_and_conditions": "..."
}
```

include `llm_customization_hints` in the output unchanged — it should be stored in Supabase alongside the program so future edits can reference it.

---

## hard constraints — never violate these

- **never change JSON keys or column names.** only values change.
- **never add fields** not present in the archetype.
- **never remove fields** from the output, even if null.
- **never cross-contaminate archetypes** — a cashback program does not get tier logic; a tiered program does not get a points currency.
- **never rewrite legal prose** in `terms_and_conditions` beyond filling placeholders.
- **never invent a perk or reward** the business cannot plausibly deliver given its industry and offering type.
- **never change `keep_fixed` values** regardless of business inputs.
